    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # metrics.stackdriver-project-id field specifies the Stackdriver project ID. This

    # not provided.

    # charge.  If metrics.backend-destination is not Stackdriver, this is
