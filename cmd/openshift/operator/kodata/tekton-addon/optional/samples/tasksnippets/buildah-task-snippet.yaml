  description: |
    Buildash task builds the source into a container image Project Atomic's Buildah build tool.
    It uses Buildah's support for building from Dockerfiles, using its buildah bud command.
    This command executes the directives in the Dockerfile to assemble a container image, then pushes that image to a container registry.
