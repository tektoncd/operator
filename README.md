# Tektoncd Operator


Kubernetes [Operator](https://operatorhub.io/getting-started) to
manage installations, updates and removal of Tektoncd projects
(pipeline, dashboard, â€¦)

> The goal of an Operator is to put operational knowledge into
> software. Previously this knowledge only resided in the minds of
> administrators, various combinations of shell scripts or automation
> software like Ansible. It was outside of your Kubernetes cluster and
> hard to integrate. With Operators, we changed that.
