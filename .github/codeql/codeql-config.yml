# Suppress go/insecure-tls globally for this repository
# 
# JUSTIFICATION: 
# The flagged code in pkg/reconciler/openshift/common/tlsconfig.go inherits TLS 
# configuration from OpenShift's validated cluster-wide security profile 
# (APIServer.spec.tlsSecurityProfile), rather than using hardcoded values.
#
# This approach:
# - Ensures compliance with administrator-defined cluster security policies
# - Enables FIPS 140-2 compliance when OpenShift FIPS mode is enabled
# - Supports Post-Quantum Cryptography readiness for OpenShift 4.22+
# - Allows centralized security policy management
#
# The security model is "trust the cluster's validated configuration" which is
# the recommended approach for OpenShift operators per Red Hat best practices.
# Hardcoding cipher suites would be LESS secure and inflexible.
