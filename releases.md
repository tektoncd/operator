# Tekton Operator Releases

## Release Frequency

Tekton Operator follows the Tekton community [release policy][release-policy]
as follows:

- Versions are numbered according to semantic versioning: `vX.Y.Z`
- A new release is produced on a monthly basis
- Four releases a year are chosen for [long term support (LTS)](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/releases.md#support-policy).
  All remaining releases are supported for approximately 1 month (until the next
  release is produced)
    - LTS releases take place in January, April, July and October every year
    - The first Tekton Operator LTS release will be **v0.63.0** in November 2022

Tekton Operator produces nightly builds, publicly available on
`ghcr.io/tektoncd/operator`. 

More details are available in the [Tekton Operator release documentation][tekton-releases-docs].

## Release Process

Tekton Operator releases are made of YAML manifests and container images.
Manifests are published to cloud object-storage as well as
[GitHub][tekton-operator-releases]. Container images are signed by
[Sigstore][sigstore] via [Tekton Chains][tekton-chains]; signatures can be
verified through the [public key][chains-public-key] hosted by the Tekton Chains
project.

- The Tekton Operator [release documents][tekton-releases-docs]
