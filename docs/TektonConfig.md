# Tekton Config

TektonConfig custom resource is the top most component of the operator which allows user to install and customize all other
components at a single place.

Operator provides support for installing and managing following operator components through `TektonConfig`:

- [TektonPipeline](./TektonPipeline.md)
- [TektonTrigger](./TektonTrigger.md)


Other than the above components depending on the platform operator also provides support for
- On both Kubernetes and OpenShift
    - [TektonChain](./TektonChain.md)
- On Kubernetes
    - [TektonDashboard](./TektonDashboard.md)
- On OpenShift
    - [TektonAddon](./TektonAddon.md)
    - [OpenShiftPipelinesAsCode](./OpenShiftPipelinesAsCode.md)

The TektonConfig CR provides the following features

Look for the particular section to understand a particular field in the spec.

### Target Namespace

This allows user to choose a namespace to install the Tekton Components such as pipelines, triggers.

By default, namespace would be `tekton-pipelines` for Kubernetes and `openshift-pipelines` for OpenShift.

### Profile

This allows user to choose which all components to install on the cluster.
There are 3 profiles available:
- `all`: This profile will install all components (TektonPipeline, TektonTrigger and TektonChain)
- `basic`:  This profile will install only TektonPipeline, TektonTrigger and TektonChain component
- `lite`: This profile will install only TektonPipeline component

On Kubernetes, `all` profile will install `TektonDashboard` and on OpenShift `TektonAddon` will be installed.

### Config

Config provides fields to configure deployments created by the Operator.
This provides following fields:
- [`nodeSelector`][node-selector]
- [`tolerations`][tolerations]
- [`priorityClassName`][priorityClassName]

User can pass the required fields and this would be passed to all Operator components which will get added in all
deployments created by Operator.

Example:
```yaml
config:
  nodeSelector:
    key: value
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  priorityClassName: system-node-critical
```

This is an `Optional` section.

**NOTE**: If `spec.config.priorityClassName` is used, then the required [`priorityClass`][priorityClass] is 
expected to be created by the user to get the Tekton resources pods in running state
### Pipeline
Pipeline section allows user to customize the Tekton pipeline features. This allow user to customize the values in configmaps.

Refer to [properties](./TektonPipeline.md#properties) section in TektonPipeline for available options.

Some of the fields have default values, so operator will add them if user haven't passed in CR. Other fields which
doesn't have default values won't be passed unless user specify them in CR. User can find those [here](./TektonPipeline.md#optional-properties).

Example:

```yaml
pipeline:
  disable-affinity-assistant: false
  disable-creds-init: false
  disable-home-env-overwrite: true
  disable-working-directory-overwrite: true
  enable-api-fields: stable
  enable-custom-tasks: false
  enable-tekton-oci-bundles: false
  metrics.pipelinerun.duration-type: histogram
  metrics.pipelinerun.level: pipelinerun
  metrics.taskrun.duration-type: histogram
  metrics.taskrun.level: taskrun
  require-git-ssh-secret-known-hosts: false
  running-in-environment-with-injected-sidecars: true
  trusted-resources-verification-no-match-policy: ignore
  performance:
    disable-ha: false
    buckets: 1
    threads-per-controller: 2
    kube-api-qps: 5.0
    kube-api-burst: 10
```

### Pruner
Pruner provides auto clean up feature for the Tekton `pipelinerun` and `taskrun` resources. In the background pruner container runs `tkn` command.

Example:
```yaml
pruner:
  disabled: false
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  resources:
    - taskrun
    - pipelinerun
  keep: 3
  # keep-since: 1440
  # NOTE: you can use either "keep" or "keep-since", not both
  prune-per-resource: true
```
- `disabled` : if the value set as `true`, pruner feature will be disabled (default: `false`)
- `schedule`: how often to run the pruner job. User can understand the schedule syntax [here][schedule].
- `resources`: supported resources for auto prune are `taskrun` and `pipelinerun`
- `keep`: maximum number of resources to keep while deleting or removing resources
- `keep-since`: retain the resources younger than the specified value in minutes
- `prune-per-resource`: if the value set as `true` (default value `false`), the `keep` or `keep-since` applied to each resource. The resources(`pipeline` and/or `task`) taken dynamically from that namespace and applied. <br> example: in a namespace `ns-1` I have two `pipeline`, named `pipeline-1` and `pipeline-2`, the out come would be: `tkn pipelinerun delete --pipeline=my-pipeline-1 --keep=3 --namespace=ns-1`, `tkn pipelinerun delete --pipeline=my-pipeline-2 --keep=3 --namespace=ns-1`. the same way works for `task` too.

> ### Note:
> if `disabled: false` and `schedule: ` with empty value, global pruner job will be disabled.
> however, if there is a prune schedule (`operator.tekton.dev/prune.schedule`) annotation present with a value in a namespace. a namespace wide pruner jobs will be created

#### Pruner Namespace annotations
By default pruner job will be created from the global pruner config (`spec.pruner`), though user can customize a pruner config to a specific namespace with the following annotations. If some of the annotations are not present or has invalid value, for that value, falls back to global value or skipped the namespace.
- `operator.tekton.dev/prune.skip` - pruner job will be skipped to a namespace, if the value set as `true`
- `operator.tekton.dev/prune.schedule` - pruner job will be created on a specific schedule
- `operator.tekton.dev/prune.keep` - maximum number of resources will be kept
- `operator.tekton.dev/prune.keep-since` - retain the resources younger than the specified value in minutes
- `operator.tekton.dev/prune.prune-per-resource` - the `keep` or `keep-since` applied to each resource
- `operator.tekton.dev/prune.resources` - can be `taskrun` and/or `pipelinerun`, both value can be specified with comma separated. example: `taskrun,pipelinerun`
- `operator.tekton.dev/prune.strategy` - allowed values: either `keep` or `keep-since`

> ### Note: 
> if a global value is not present the following values will be consider as default value <br> 
> `resources: pipelinerun` <br>
> `keep: 100` <br>
### Addon

TektonAddon install some resources along with Tekton Pipelines on the cluster. This provides few ClusterTasks, PipelineTemplates.

This section allows to customize installation of those resources through params. You can read more about the supported params [here](./TektonAddon.md).

Example:
```yaml
addon:
  params:
    - name: "clusterTask"
      value: "true"
    - name: "pipelineTemplates"
      value: "true"
```

**NOTE**: TektonAddon is currently available for OpenShift Platform only. Enabling this for Kubernetes platform is in roadmap
of Operator.

### Hub

This is to enable/disable showing hub resources in pipeline builder of devconsole(OpenShift UI). By default, the field is
not there in the config object. If you want to disable the integration, you can add the param like below in config with value `false`. 
The possible values are `true` and `false`.

Example:
```yaml
hub:
  params:
    - name: enable-devconsole-integration
      value: "false"
```

### Dashboard

Dashboard provides configuration options for the Tekton Dashboard if the specified profile value includes the Dashboard component. (E.g. `all` on Kubernetes)

Example:

```yaml
dashboard:
  readonly: true
```

- `readonly`: If set to true, install the Dashboard in read-only mode

This is an `Optional` section.

### Resolvers

As part of TektonPipelines, resolvers are installed which are by default enabled. User can disable them through TektonConfig.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig
metadata:
  name: config
spec:
  pipeline:
    enable-bundles-resolver: true
    enable-cluster-resolver: true
    enable-git-resolver: true
    enable-hub-resolver: true
```

User can also provide resolver specific configurations through TektonConfig. The Default configurations are **not** added by default in TektonConfig.
To override default configurations, user can provide the configurations as below. You can find the default configurations [here](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/main/config)

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonConfig
metadata:
  name: config
spec:
  pipeline:
    bundles-resolver-config:
      default-service-account: pipelines
    cluster-resolver-config:
      default-namespace: cluster-resolver-test
    enable-bundles-resolver: true
    enable-cluster-resolver: true
    enable-git-resolver: true
    enable-hub-resolver: true
    git-resolver-config:
      server-url: localhost.com
    hub-resolver-config:
      default-tekton-hub-catalog: tekton
```

### OpenShiftPipelinesAsCode

The PipelinesAsCode section allows you to customize the Pipelines as Code features. When you change the TektonConfig CR, the Operator automatically applies the settings to custom resources and configmaps in your installation.

Some of the fields have default values, so operator will add them if the user hasn't passed in CR. Other fields which
don't have default values unless the user specifies them. User can find those [here](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/install/settings/#pipelines-as-code-configuration-settings).

Example:

```yaml
platforms:
  openshift:
    pipelinesAsCode:
      enable: true
      settings:
        application-name: Pipelines as Code CI
        auto-configure-new-github-repo: "false"
        bitbucket-cloud-check-source-ip: "true"
        custom-console-name: ""
        custom-console-url: ""
        custom-console-url-pr-details: ""
        custom-console-url-pr-tasklog: ""
        error-detection-from-container-logs: "false"
        error-detection-max-number-of-lines: "50"
        error-detection-simple-regexp: ^(?P<filename>[^:]*):(?P<line>[0-9]+):(?P<column>[0-9]+):([
          ]*)?(?P<error>.*)
        error-log-snippet: "true"
        hub-catalog-name: tekton
        hub-url: https://api.hub.tekton.dev/v1
        remote-tasks: "true"
        secret-auto-create: "true"
        secret-github-app-token-scoped: "true"
```

**NOTE**: OpenShiftPipelinesAsCode is currently available for the OpenShift Platform only.
