# Tekton Operator Repo CI/CD

_Why does Tekton Operator have a folder called `tekton`? Cuz we think it would be cool
if the `tekton` folder were the place to look for CI/CD logic in most repos!_

We dogfood our projects by using Tekton Pipelines to build, test and release
Tekton Projects! This directory contains the
[`Tasks`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tasks.md) and
[`Pipelines`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelines.md)
that we use for Tekton Operator build, test and release.
